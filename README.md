# NASRAC: NG
# Meaning
North American Stockcar Racing Analytics Competition: Next Generation

# Origin
The inspiration for the title and this project comes from a game from a few years ago, which you can find at http://www.nasrac.com/

There really isn't a good NASCAR simulation for drivers or team owners out there. There are many, however, that are run manually by spreadsheet, formulas and values. While fun to play nonetheless, it is cumbersome for the league owners to run races and process the data. This application is being developed specifically to alleviate that workload and make the process easier so that multiple seasons can be run a) at a time and b) at a faster rate, leading to more fun for all of us involved!
